## Build Our Hybrid Swarm

SSH into your Linux node (it should be <location>-lin-#). Your DNS name, username and password will be on the paper you received earlier.

```
ssh docker@<location-lin-#>.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com)
```
Create your swarm by issuing the `docker swarm init` command. This command will create a swarm cluster, and add the current node as a manager.

```
$ docker swarm init
Swarm initialized: current node (z42u37g25lrmcgbpyef9fd06r) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-4qm2iur0lkqjmmxlfivyj7rdn9nsso216vaxybhojgmbwa3su7-3vzae67xszr1yphz6flr9emff \
    10.0.2.32:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

Copy the join command and paste it into a text editor, then remove the '\' and make the command a single line (this is because Windows does not know how to handle the linux-style `\`)

It should end up looking something like this:

```
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4qm2iur0lkqjmmxlfivyj7rdn9nsso216vaxybhojgmbwa3su7-3vzae67xszr1yphz6flr9emff 10.0.2.32:2377
```
Use your RDP client to connect into your Windows node (the address should be similar to `<location>-win-#.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com` your username and password are on the paper you received earlier)

Once connected to your Windows Server 2016 VM open a Powershell window by clicking the `Start` button (which looks like a flag in the lower left corner) and then click the Windows Power Shell icon (Do NOT choose Windows Powershell ISE) near the top right.

In the Powershell window paste in your Docker swarm join command. This command will contact the swarm manager you just created and use the token supplied to join the Swarm cluster.

```
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4qm2iur0lkqjmmxlfivyj7rdn9nsso216vaxybhojgmbwa3su7-3vzae67xszr1yphz6flr9emff 10.0.2.32:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```
> **Note**: Sometimes joining the swarm will cause your RDP connection to reset, simply reconnect

Switch back to your Linux VM.

To see the nodes in your cluster issue the `docker node ls` command.

```
$ docker node ls
ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS
phud37l5prpy4bk76pfdkfofw     win-pdx-20          Ready               Active
z42u37g25lrmcgbpyef9fd06r *   lin-pdx-20          Ready               Active              Leader
```

We can verify the operating system family for each node by using docker inspect.

> **Note** The command below uses the hostnames show above, your hostnames will be different

```
$ docker node inspect win-pdx-20 | grep OS
                "OS": "windows"
$ docker node inspect lin-pdx-20 | grep OS
                "OS": "linux"
```
Let's look at the OS information in a bit more detail. Issue the `docker node inspect` command on your Linux node.

`$ docker inspect lin-pdx-20`

Scroll up in your terminal until you find the `Description` section. It should look similar to this:

```
"Description": {
            "Hostname": "lin-pdx-20",
            "Platform": {
                "Architecture": "x86_64",
                "OS": "linux"
            },
```

What we want to notice here is the hierarchy. We inspected the node, and the `OS` is listed under `Platform` so the full path for the `OS` label is `node.platform.OS`. This information will be used in a later part of the lab.

## Deploy Linux and Windows web applications

Now that we've build our cluster, let's deploy a couple of web apps.

We're going to clone the workshop repo onto each machine, and then build a simple webapp for each operating system.

Let's start on the Linux node.

Make sure you're in your home directory
`$ cd ~`

And then clone the repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mikegcoleman/hybrid-workshop.git
Cloning into 'hybrid-workshop'...
remote: Counting objects: 13, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 13 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (13/13), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```
Now change into the `linux_tweet_app` directory.
`$ cd ~/hybrid-workshop/linux_tweet_app/`

Next build your Linux tweet webapp. Be sure to user your own Docker ID when you build the image.

> **Note**: Feel free to examine the Dockerfile in this directory if you'd like to see how the image is being built.

```
$ docker build -t <your docker id>/linux_tweet_app .

```
Next we'll log into Docker hub and push our image up there for future use.

```
$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: <your docker id>
Password: <your docker id password>
Login Succeeded
```
After you log in, use `docker push` to upload your image up to Docker Hub.
```
$ docker push <your docker id>/linux_tweet_app
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/<your docker id>/linux_tweet_app]

```
Now let's run our application by by creating a new service.

```
$ docker service create --detach=true -p 8080:80 --name linux_tweet_app <your docker id>/linux_tweet_app:
sbkz4dl6slrd6xl7e6rp1qlt2
```
Let's look at each part of that command:
`docker service create`: Creates a new service based on the supplied image (<your docker id>/linux_tweet_app)
`--detach=true`: Runs our service in the background
`-p 8080:80`: Instructs Docker to route any requests coming in on port 8080 to our service running on port 80.
`--name linux_tweet_app`: Applies a name to our service (if this is omitted Docker will choose one at random)

Use the `docker service ls` command to verify our service was created.

```
$ docker service ls
ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE                                 PORTS
sbkz4dl6slrd        linux_tweet_app     replicated          1/1                 mikegcoleman/linux_tweet_app:latest   *:8080->80/tcp
```
And we can check the tasks in our service by running 'docker service ps' on our service

```
$ docker service ps linux_tweet_app
ID                  NAME                IMAGE                                 NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE                ERROR               PORTS

```
On your windows machine, open a PowerShell window.

`mkdir scm`

`cd .\scm`
